        <h3 class="h-center">How Kellogg Course Bidding Works</h3>
            <p>Kellogg's course bidding system is purportedly based on the free market economic concept, in which the costs of goods (in this case, courses) are determined by consumers in the open market. In reality, this is not the case as supply is dictated by the administration and staff. Furthermore, students have finite, expirable resources (in this case, points) to expend on courses.
                Kellogg's official stance on the merit of the points system is that it enables students to spend their bid points according to the value they assign to a given course and/or professor. However, the bidding system contains stark contradictions to this philosophy, as detailed in the following sections. 
            </p>
            <p class="oblique">Below are the key elements that comprise the bidding system.</p>
        <h4 class="h-purple">Points</h4>
            <p>Points are the <span class="emphasis">crux</span> of the bidding system. As 2Y and MMM students take required core courses in their first fall quarter, they are allotted 2,000 points to use as they see fit in their first Winter and Spring quarters. 2Ys in their second year, along with 1Ys, are allotted 3,000 points to spend throughout all three quarters in the academic year.
            A crucial caveat is that points <span class="emphasis">do not roll over</span> from year to year, so if you have unused points at the end of your first year, they are forever lost in the ether.</p>
        <h4 class="h-purple">The "Vickrey" Auction</h4>
            <p>The course bidding system is an auction that is most similar to the Vickrey auction style. When students bid on courses, their total bid amount cannot exceed their point balance and they cannot bid on more than 5 courses (including courses they are pre-enrolled in, such as certain required courses by a program or application-based courses. The bidding system prioritizes bids for a class in descending order to determine the students who will secure a roster position. If a student secures, or "wins," a spot on the course roster, he or she pays the amount of the <span class="emphasis">lowest winning bid</span>, rather than his or her initial bid amount. For example, if I bid 200 points on a class with 50 seats and the 50th seat's bid is 100, everyone in the course is "charged" 100 points. If a student does not bid enough to secure a seat in a class, he or she is placed on the waitlist based in descending order based on bid amount. There are 2 phases of bidding - in the first phase, students can bid on all available seats (barring those reserved for part-time or exchange students). In the second phase, students can use their remaining points to bid on any courses that still have open seats. 
            
            The minimum bid for a course is 1 points, although course "closing costs" can range from as low as 0 to as high as 2000 (Shout out to Vicki Medvec's famous Negotiations class).</p> 
        <h4 class="h-purple">Historical Data</h4>
            <p>Kellogg provides students historical bid data dating back to Fall 2015. Many students find this data to be helpful, as it can help students predict how much a class will cost them. Upon further inspection, though, one can argue that this data is a hindrance to students as well as antithetical to Kellogg's stance that the bidding system allows students to pay what they think a course is worth. Instead of bidding based on one's perceived value of a course, the classic Kellogg type-A person scours historical data to inform their bidding decisions and often end up paying significantly more than their perceived value for high-demand courses. This inflation is exacerbated by the "closing cost" system as students do not know what the course will actually cost them. On top of that, course costs can succumb to additional inflation in earlier quarters in the academic year, when students have more points to spend. </p>

                <h3 class="h-center">Course Price Inflation</h3>
                <p>Beyond my personal frustrations surrounding the course bidding system, there is data to back up the claim the the average closing cost of courses is on the rise. I analyzed several years of historical bid data from Winter quarters, the quarter in which I believe there is the most number of points in play because first-years enter the market. Comparing 2018 to 2019 aone, the average closing cost increased by <span class="emphasis">a staggering 26%</span>. The chart to the right outlines the year-over-year average closting cost trendline and the labels represent the average number of seats per class.</p>
