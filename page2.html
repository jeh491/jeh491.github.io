            <h3 class="h-center">Proposed Improvements to the Course Bidding System</h3>
            <p>Rather than passively complain, I propose several key improvements that could be made to the course bidding system. I strongly believe the implementation of any single item, or combination of items, would not only significantly enhance the course bidding system, but also the overall Kellogg experience. It's important to note I am operating under the assumption that Kellogg has already exhausted every available option to increase the frequency/availability of high-demand courses and professors. </p>
            <p class="white">space</p>
            <h4 class="h-purple">Allow Points to Roll Over</h4>
            <p>I'll begin with the most controversial recommendation as it is near and dear to my heart. Last spring, I was out-bid on virtually every course I wanted to take and was left with <span class="emphasis">1200+ unused points.</span>
            This was soul-crushing and frustrating. The administration claims that point rollover would be unfair to the 1Ys. Pardon my hot-take, but the 1Ys have the luxury of earning the same degree as 2Ys at a lower cost in terms of both money and time. I argue that point rollover would level the playing field for those that spend 6 quarters worth of tuition on an MBA rather than 4. 
            Furthermore, rollover would help rectify extenuating circumstances, such as when professors that only teach a particular course once per year take sabbatical/time off, leaving only one opportunity for a student in a two-year program to try to win a seat.</p>
            <h4 class="h-purple">Allot Points Per Quarter, Rather Than in Aggregate</h4>
            <p>Admittedly, this solution could have drawbacks, especially if a student does not have enough high-cost courses that they wish to take in a quarter. That said, I think it would quell the exorbitant inflation that many popular courses are succumb to year-over-year by forcing students to bid less aggressively and, ideally, drive down the price of many courses to a value closer to many people's actual perception.</p>
            <h4 class="h-purple">Abolish Historical Bid Data</h4>
            <p>In the spirit of the "fair" market concept, removing the variable of historical bid data from the equation would result in people placing bids that truly reflect their perceived value of the course. Arguably, the historical bid data detracts from the fundamental sealed bid concept in a Vickrey auction and it perpetuates the aforementioned price inflation issue. </p>
            <h4 class="h-purple">Accept More Auditors</h4>
            <p>Many courses don't allow auditors, or only allow a small number. If students are willing to commit their time to auditing a course on top of their existing courseload, Kellogg professors should be more amenable to sharing their gospel. In the case of classroom/capacity constraints, Kellogg could offer class recordings for a limited time during or after the course to ensure that no student is unable to access the teachings of a course that they wish to take.</p>
